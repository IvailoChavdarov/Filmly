        "FactInfo": "Motion pictures date all the way back to the 1890s when the first moving picture cameras were invented. However, the very first moving picture - The Roundhay Garden Scene - was actually a product of the 1880s. In 1888, French inventor Louis Le Prince filmed his family prancing around in a circle in a whopping two second clip. While that seems insignificant now, it\u0027s innovation is what would eventually lead to commercialized cameras and motion pictures. ",

        "FactInfo": "What fun would it be sitting in a theatre while random, everyday scenes scrolled by silently on a screen? Awkward. To make up for the lack of sound in a film, sometimes a band would play live music while the movie was playing. After all, who wants to hear someone going to town on a bag of popcorn in a deaf theater?",
